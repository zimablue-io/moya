 * not acceptable for them (see .grok/skills/og/SKILL.md).
 *
 * Games must also emit og:type="x:game" in the root head so X can present the
 * unfurl as a game card (see og skill § "og:type for games").
 *
 * Checked on the filesystem (not the served head) because live preview has no
 * VITE_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME and renders no og:image tag at all, so the page alone
 * can't reveal the placeholder. og:type does not need a host and is checked
 * on the __root.tsx source.
